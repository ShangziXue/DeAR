# \[NeurIPS2024\] Decompose, Analyze and Rethink: Solving Intricate Problems with Human-like Reasoning Cycle(DeAR) 

The DeAR (Decompose-Analyze-Rethink) framework is designed to improve reasoning accuracy in large language models (LLMs) by emulating human-like problem-solving strategies. This approach focuses on constructing a reasoning tree that decomposes complex problems into manageable sub-questions, analyzes each sub-question with rationales, and rethinks prior solutions based on new insights. The cycle of Decompose, Analyze, and Rethink fosters iterative refinement and error correction, ensuring a more accurate solution.

## Key Highlights ##
**1.Tree-of-Thoughts (ToT) vs. DeAR:** The DeAR framework outperforms the Tree-of-Thoughts (ToT) approach by introducing flexible reasoning trees that adapt in real time. In Figure 1, you can see a comparison of how both methods handle reasoning steps. While ToT rigidly maintains a fixed number of branches, DeAR dynamically updates its tree based on logical analysis, allowing for timely error correction and more accurate results.

**2.DeAR Cycle:** The DeAR cycle (illustrated in Figure 2) is at the core of our framework. It involves three stages:
*Decompose:* Breaking the complex question into simpler sub-questions.
*Analyze:* Solving the sub-questions with reasoning and feedback.
*Rethink:* Revising earlier solutions based on new information, ensuring logical consistency and precision in the final answer.
The frameworkâ€™s performance has been tested on complex reasoning benchmarks like ScienceQA, StrategyQA, and GSM8K, demonstrating its superiority over other state-of-the-art methods, such as GoT and ToT, in both accuracy and efficiency.
