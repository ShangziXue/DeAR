You should based on the specific logic of the question to determine the number of sub-questions and output them sequentially. If you consider the question Q to be sufficiently simple and no further decomposition is needed, then output “End.” I will provide you with three questions similar to q, along with their decomposed sub-questions as examples. You can learn from these examples on how to decompose such questions, and then apply what you’ve learned to decompose Q.\n
